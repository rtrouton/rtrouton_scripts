# This script is designed to use the Jamf Pro API to identify the individual IDs of 
# the policies stored on a Jamf Pro server then do the following:
#
# 1. Back up existing downloaded policies
# 2. Download the policy as XML
# 3. Identify the policy name
# 4. Categorize the downloaded policy
# 5. Save the policy to a specified directory

# If setting up a specific user account with limited rights, here are the required API privileges
# for the account on the Jamf Pro server:

# Jamf Pro Server Objects:

# Policies: Read

# Set exit error status

# If you choose to specify a directory to save the downloaded policies into,
# please enter the complete directory path into the PolicyDownloadDirectory
# variable below.

# If the PolicyDownloadDirectory isn't specified above, a directory will be
# created and the complete directory path displayed by the script.

# If you choose to hardcode API information into the script, set one or more of the following values:
#
# The username for an account on the Jamf Pro server with sufficient API privileges
# The password for the account
# The Jamf Pro URL

# Set the Jamf Pro URL here if you want it hardcoded.

# If you do not want to hardcode API information into the script, you can also store
# these values in a ~/Library/Preferences/com.github.jamfpro-info.plist file.
#
# To create the file and set the values, run the following commands and substitute
# your own values where appropriate:
#
# To store the Jamf Pro URL in the plist file:
# defaults write com.github.jamfpro-info jamfpro_url https://jamf.pro.server.goes.here:port_number_goes_here
#
# To store the account username in the plist file:
# defaults write com.github.jamfpro-info jamfpro_user account_username_goes_here
#
# To store the account password in the plist file:
# defaults write com.github.jamfpro-info jamfpro_password account_password_goes_here
#
# If the com.github.jamfpro-info.plist file is available, the script will read in the
# relevant information from the plist file.
