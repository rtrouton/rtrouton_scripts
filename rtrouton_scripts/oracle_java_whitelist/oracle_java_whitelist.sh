# This script will add two servers to the Oracle Java Exception Site List. 
# If the servers are already in the whitelist, it will note that in the log, then exit.
# More servers can be added as needed. The existing server entries can also be set to be
# empty (i.e. SERVER2='') as the script will do a check to see if either SERVER value
# is set to be null.

# Enter as many servers as needed -- one per line with single quotes
SERVERS=('http://server.name.here'
'https://server.name.here'
'https://another.server.name.here'
'https://as.many.as.needed')
