# The script is designed to address the Zoom vulnerabilities described in CVE-2019–13450:
# https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13450
#
# In the Zoom Client through 4.4.4, RingCentral 7.0.136380.0312 and Zhumu 4.2.137102.0612 on macOS,  
# remote attackers can force a user to join a video call with the video camera active. 
# This occurs because any web site can interact with the Zoom web server on localhost port 19421 or 19424. 
# 
# NOTE: a machine remains vulnerable if the Zoom Client was installed in the past and then uninstalled. 
# Blocking exploitation requires additional steps, such as the ZDisableVideo preference and/or killing the web server, 
# deleting the ~/.zoomus directory, and creating a ~/.zoomus plain file.
#
# The script performs the following actions:
#
# Stops the ZoomOpener, RingCentralOpener and ZhumuOpener processes for the logged-in user.
#
# Sets /Library/Preferences/us.zoom.config.plist to disable Zoom video auto-connection
#
# Checks the existing user folders in /Users for the presence of the Library/Preferences directory.
# Once the Library/Preferences directory is located, script sets the individual users'
# ~/Library/Preferences/us.zoom.config.plist to disable Zoom video auto-connection.
# 
# Next, the script checks for the presence of the .zoomus, .ringcentralopener
# the .zhumuopener directories in users' home folders. 
# If these directories are detected, the following actions take place:
#
# If present, the .zoomus directory is deleted.
# A file named .zoomus is created.
# The .zoomus file is set to be unreadable and unwritable.
# The .zoomus file is set to be owned by the owner of the home folder.
#
# If present, the .ringcentralopener directory is deleted.
# A file named .ringcentralopener is created.
# The .ringcentralopener file is set to be unreadable and unwritable.
# The .ringcentralopener file is set to be owned by the owner of the home folder.
#
# If present, the .zhumuopener directory is deleted.
# A file named .zhumuopener is created.
# The .zhumuopener file is set to be unreadable and unwritable.
# The .zhumuopener file is set to be owned by the owner of the home folder.

# Checks to see if any user accounts are currently logged into the console (AKA logged into the GUI via the OS loginwindow)

users_logged_in_at_loginwindow=$(who | grep console)

# If a user is logged in, stop the existing ZoomOpener, RingCentralOpener, and
# ZhumuOpener processes for the logged-in user.
